# PassportChallenge

Although this was a simple, fun project, it still felt unfinished.

I decided to continue working on it as it touches on essential Android functionality. 
The application was built using only what is included with the Android SDK, however, as I finished
up the last of the requirements, it didn't live up to my expectations.

The final build, although it worked, it was slow, animations were bad, user warnings were not present, 
it just had so much left to be desired.

Along the way I've learned that the design is one of the most difficult and most important things 
to consider when building an application, I really undervalued the importance of this.
I spent many a night reading and learning more about the material design guidelines. 

As I continue work on the app, I expect it to be faster and more user friendly.  I will also be incorporating 
other libraries to further increase ease of use and teach myself some more along the way. 

Thank you Passport, this has been a fun little project.
